        <h2>Top 10 Skincare Tips for Glowing Skin</h2>
        <p><em>Achieve radiant, healthy skin with these dermatologist-approved routines and habits.</em></p>
      
        <h3>1. Know Your Skin Type</h3>
        <p>Understanding your skin type‚Äîwhether it's oily, dry, combination, or sensitive‚Äîis the first step to choosing the right skincare products.</p>
      
        <h3>2. Cleanse Gently but Thoroughly</h3>
        <p>Use a mild, non-stripping cleanser twice a day to remove dirt, oil, and makeup without damaging your skin barrier.</p>
      
        <h3>3. Never Skip Sunscreen</h3>
        <p>Apply SPF 30 or higher every morning, even on cloudy days. Sun damage is one of the biggest causes of premature aging.</p>
      
        <h3>4. Hydrate Inside and Out</h3>
        <p>Drink plenty of water and use a hydrating moisturizer to keep your skin supple and plump.</p>
      
        <h3>5. Exfoliate Regularly</h3>
        <p>Exfoliate 1-2 times a week using a chemical exfoliant (like AHA or BHA) to remove dead skin cells and unclog pores.</p>
      
        <h3>6. Don't Overdo It</h3>
        <p>Using too many products can irritate your skin. Stick to a simple routine and slowly introduce new products one at a time.</p>
      
        <h3>7. Use Targeted Serums</h3>
        <p>Include serums with active ingredients like Vitamin C, hyaluronic acid, or niacinamide to address specific concerns like dullness or acne.</p>
      
        <h3>8. Maintain a Healthy Diet</h3>
        <p>Eat antioxidant-rich foods such as berries, leafy greens, and nuts to nourish your skin from within.</p>
      
        <h3>9. Sleep and Stress Management</h3>
        <p>Ensure 7-8 hours of quality sleep every night and manage stress with activities like yoga or journaling.</p>
      
        <h3>10. Be Consistent</h3>
        <p>Results don't happen overnight. Stick to your routine and be patient‚Äîhealthy skin takes time and care.</p>
